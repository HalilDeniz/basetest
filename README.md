# Base64 Encoder/Decoder

This program works with Python 3 and provides a fast and convenient way to encode and decode Base64 strings and files directly from the terminal.

## Usage

### Encode a String

To encode a string, use the following command:

```bash
python3 basek覺r.py -e or --encode "base64 encode this"
```

Simply replace `"base64 encode this"` with the text you want to encode.

### Decode a String

To decode a Base64-encoded string, use the following command:

```bash
python3 basek覺r.py -d or --decode "YmFzZTY0"
```

Replace `"YmFzZTY0"` with the Base64-encoded string you want to decode.

### Encode a File

To encode the contents of a text file, use the following command:

```bash
python3 basek覺r.py -fe or --fileencode encode.txt
```

Replace `encode.txt` with the name of your text file. The program will encode the file's contents.

### Decode a File

To decode the contents of a Base64-encoded text file, use the following command:

```bash
python3 basek覺r.py -fd or --filedecode decode.txt
```

Replace `decode.txt` with the name of your Base64-encoded text file. The program will decode the file's contents.

## Note

Using online Base64 encode/decode websites is convenient, but running this program in your terminal offers a faster and more practical alternative.

## Enjoy Using the Program!
